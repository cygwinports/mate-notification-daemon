	# do not install the DBus service file because multiple programs
	# can provide org.freedesktop.Notifications (e.g. gnome-shell,
	# GNOME notification-daemon, Ubuntu notify-osd, XFCE notifyd)
	# but only one can run at a given time.  The supported solution is
	# for none of them to register for DBus autostart, but leave the
	# session manager to launch the service provider for the given desktop.
